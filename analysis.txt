California Housing Data — EDA Report
1. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information on census block groups in California, including housing characteristics and median house value.
After filtering out unrealistic values (AveOccup ≥ 10, AveBedrms ≥ 10), we retained realistic residential districts only to avoid hotels or short-term rentals.

Columns used in analysis:

MedInc: Median household income (×10,000 USD)

HouseAge: Average age of houses (years)

AveRooms: Average rooms per household

AveBedrms: Average bedrooms per household

Population: Total population of the block group

AveOccup: Average occupants per household

Latitude & Longitude: Geolocation

target: Median house value (×100,000 USD)

2. Target Distribution

The median house value ranges mostly between 0.5 and 5 (×100,000 USD).

The histogram shows a right-skew, meaning a small number of very expensive houses exist.

Insight: Most houses are in the moderate price range, but outliers may affect mean-based metrics.

3. Median Income vs House Value

Strong positive relationship: higher median income districts have higher house values.

Scatter plot shows a roughly linear trend with some variance at higher income levels.

Insight: Median income is the strongest predictor of house value.

4. House Age vs House Value

House value is slightly higher for newer houses, but not strongly linear.

Older neighborhoods have more spread in house values.

Insight: Age affects value, but it is less important than income or location.

5. Average Rooms vs House Value

House value increases with more rooms, but there are outliers (some very large homes with moderate value).

Relationship is moderate, suggesting size matters but is not the only factor.

6. Average Occupancy vs House Value

Higher occupancy households tend to have slightly lower house values.

The relationship is weak after filtering, but very crowded households are rare.

7. Feature Correlations

Highest positive correlations with house value:

MedInc (strongest)

AveRooms

Moderate correlations: HouseAge, AveBedrms

Weak or negative correlations: Population, AveOccup

Insight: Income and number of rooms are the most predictive features.

8. Geographic Distribution

Coastal and northern California districts tend to have higher house values.

Inland and southern districts tend to be less expensive.

Insight: Location matters a lot, and latitude/longitude could be an important feature for modeling.

9. Summary

Median income is the most important factor.

Geography (coastal vs inland) strongly influences house prices.

Size (rooms) and house age have moderate impact.

Filtering unrealistic values improved clarity of scatter plots.

Skewed target distribution suggests models should handle outliers carefully.
